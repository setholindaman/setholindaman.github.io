    <a img src="SethsPhoto.html"></a>

    <p>Aspiring Data Engineer completing my education at the University of Denver and will finish in August of 2019.
        My goal is to gain entry into the data analytics industry and
        I’m looking forward to excelling in this new career along with the many opportunities it presents.</p>
    <p>I bring with me a bachelor’s degree in accounting from Kutztown University of PA and over ten years of sales and
        client customer service.
        I am a highly skilled problem solver and effective communicator. While attending DU I developed a strong
        knowledge of Python,
        Excel, MySQL, Javascript, HTML, and Tableau. In addition, I always strive to continuously learn and practice new
        skills and
        inner disciplines. As a former fine jewelry store manager and lender, I provided exceptional professionalism
        when helping clients and
        look to bring these skills to a reputable organization.</p>
