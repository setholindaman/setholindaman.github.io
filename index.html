  <p>Aspiring Data Engineer completing my education at the University of Denver and will finish in August of 2019. 
    My goal is to gain entry into the data analytics industry and 
    I’m looking forward to excelling in this new career along with the many opportunities it presents.</p>
  <p>I bring with me a bachelor’s degree in accounting from Kutztown University of PA and over ten years of sales and client customer service. 
    I am a highly skilled problem solver and effective communicator. While attending DU I developed a strong knowledge of Python, 
    Excel, MySQL, Javascript, HTML, and Tableau. In addition, I always strive to continuously learn and practice new skills and 
    inner disciplines. As a former fine jewelry store manager and lender, I provided exceptional professionalism when helping clients and 
    look to bring these skills to a reputable organization.</p>
